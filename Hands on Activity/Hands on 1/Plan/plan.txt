Step 1: Initial Access

- Exploit the outdated firmware on the bank's main security cameras. A buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2023-1456) allows us to gain root access to the camera's control system. This will disable the cameras for a 10-minute window, enough time for us to enter the building undetected.

- Ghost, you need to be onsite to execute this. Use the wireless access point outside the bank’s north entrance to connect to the internal network.

Step 2: Breach Internal Network

- Once inside, use the credentials from the accountant that we phished last week, it will give you access to his admin workstation.

- Credentials: His compromised admin account (user: j.smith@centralbank.com, password: John123456!). Ghost, ensure all access logs are wiped immediately after use.


Step 3: Access the Financial Systems

- Use the bank’s secure terminal to access the financial systems. Deploy our script, to transfer funds. Transfer amounts to multiple offshore accounts in sums not exceeding $500,000 each to avoid triggering the bank’s automated fraud detection systems.

Step 4: Exit Strategy

- I will maintain surveillance remotely, monitoring police frequencies. Once the funds are transferred, exit through the staff entrance using the cloned RFID badge.

- Meet me on September 28 at 11:45 PM, I left the address encoded in the address.txt file. Ensure all tools are wiped clean of prints and data. Destroy any incriminating evidence.


Remember, timing is everything. We execute this flawlessly, and we're set for life.
